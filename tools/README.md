This folder is a collection of snapshots and tables corresponding to processed & evaluated performance on slides.

Each of the directories is labelled as `seg.[magnification].[model_type]`.

The contents of each directory ought to be uniformly formatted so iterating over them should be as simple as possible.

The scripts under `notebooks/` process these logs & tables into graphs.
